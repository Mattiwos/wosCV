# wosCV Project Summary

**Motion Detection:**
- wosCV includes motion detection capabilities, allowing it to identify and track movements.

**Surveillance and Pattern Analysis:**
- In the surveillance domain, wosCV collects data and utilizes machine learning to draw patterns from people's movements. This suggests an ability to analyze and interpret human behavior for security or observational purposes.

**Driving Assistance:**
- wosCV is equipped with features for self-driving applications. It can detect roads and potentially contribute to the navigation and decision-making processes in autonomous vehicles.

**3D Mapping (Mapper):**
- The Mapper component of wosCV focuses on 3D mapping of an area. This suggests a capability to create spatial representations, possibly for applications such as environmental mapping or navigation.

In summary, wosCV is a comprehensive project that encompasses motion detection, surveillance with pattern analysis, driving assistance for self-driving vehicles, and 3D mapping capabilities.

 

## How to run program:  
```
pip install youtube-dl==2020.12.2
pip install -U youtube-dl==2020.12.2 pafy
```
to test program run main.py which will grab a live stream and start capturing faces and place them into a folder  
```
python wosFaceDetection.py
```


## TODO:  
* [ ] allow main.py to take an input for a live stream youtube or select from local computer
* [ ] Use deepface to sort the faces and create a directory for each unique faces
* [ ] Use ML to predict when the person when show up based on previous appeariances
* [ ] make documentation for everything
